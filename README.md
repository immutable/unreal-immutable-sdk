# Immutable SDK for Unreal Engine

## User Guide

### Supported Platforms

- Windows 10 (64-bit)
- MacOS

### Supported Unreal Engine Versions

- Unreal Engine 5.0 and above
- Unreal Engine 4.26 and above

### Installation

To install the plugin download it into your project's `Plugins` folder, e.g.: `MyGame/Plugins/unreal-immutable-sdk`.

> [!NOTE]
> For Unreal Engine 4.26 and above we use Blui as a browser instead of inbuilt browser. Please update `immutable.uplugin->Plugins->WebBrowserWidget` to false and restart your UE4 editor.

### Setup

#### Blueprint

See the included sample widgets in `All`->`Plugins`->`Immutable Content` in the Unreal Editor content browser for examples of how to use the plugin in Blueprint.  If you don't see a `Plugins` folder under `All` you may need to enable `Show Plugin Content` in the content browser's `Settings` menu.

#### C++

See `ImmutablePassport.h` for the C++ Passport API.  Follow the same sequence of steps as the Blueprint widget example to initialise and connect Passport and retrieve account data.

### Quick Start

#### Passport Login Flow

See this Blueprint showing how to login to passport ![Passport Login Blueprint](PassportLoginFlow.jpg)

Here are the steps to login to passport:

1. `Initialise Passport` to initialise passport instance.
2. Check if there are stored credentials from previous login.
3. If stored credentials found, `ConnectSilent` uses the saved credentials to login to Passport.
4. When no stored credentials found or step 3 fails, attempt to make a new Connection to login to Passport using `Connect`. This will open the gamer's default browser and take them through the auth flow.

Once the gamer is connected to Passport, the SDK will store your credentials (access, ID, and refresh tokens).

> [!NOTE]
> We use the [Device Code Authorisation](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/device-authorization-flow#:~:text=Your%20Auth0%20Authorization%20Server%20redirects,authorized%20to%20access%20the%20API.) flow to authenticate and authorise gamers.

#### Log out of Passport

See this Blueprint showing how to logout from passport ![Passport Logout Blueprint](PassportLogoutFlow.jpg)

See the [ImmutablePassport.h](https://github.com/immutable/unreal-immutable-sdk/blob/dc39324db204f2ba30e9c9f0ca25c070987785cb/Source/Immutable/Public/Immutable/ImmutablePassport.h#L115C8-L115C8) header for the full API.

## Examples

- **Sample Blueprints** - see the [sample blueprints](https://github.com/immutable/unreal-immutable-sdk/tree/main/Content/BlueprintSampleContent) for examples of how to use the Immutable Unity SDK.

- **Sample Game** - see the [sample game](https://github.com/immutable/sample-unreal-game) for example of how to use the Immutable Unity SDK.

## Plugin Maintainers' Guide

### Prerequisites

- git
- Epic Games Launcher
- Unreal Engine installed from the Epic Games Launcher; you will need every version that the plugin supports (currently 4.27, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2)
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ support
- Jetbrains Rider IDE (recommended for working with Unreal Engine C++ code)

If not Rider, Visual Studio is fine and even better with the Resharper plugin.

### Getting Started

See [user guide](#user-guide) to install the plugin, with one caveat:  If you want to open the project and plugin in an IDE you'll need to create your Unreal project as a C++ project.  If you've already accidentally created your Unreal project as BluePrint-only you can convert it to a BluePrint-and-C++ project by adding any C++ class from the `Add New C++ Class` option in the Unreal Editor's `File` menu.

### Debugging the Embedded Browser

#### Embedded Browser Logs

See `Saved/Logs/cef3.log` in your Unreal project.

#### JS Console Output

In Unreal Engine 5.1+ the project is set up so that `console.log()` will pass all the way through to the Unreal console.  This isn't available in UE5.0 and earlier but you can still use Chromium's remote debugging (see below).

#### Remote Debugging

To set up Chromium remote debugging, edit project build/launch configurations in your IDE to add the following program command line argument to the appropriate configurations: `cefdebug=9222`

Next, launch the game and then open a separate Chrome/Chromium browser and navigate to `chrome://inspect` where your app should be listed, sometimes intermittently or after a delay, under the `Remote Target #localhost` section.  Click `inspect` to launch the remote debugging session.

## Changelog Management
